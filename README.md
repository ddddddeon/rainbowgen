rainbowgen
==========

Generate MD5 &amp; SHA-1 lookup tables from a user-supplied wordlist. Outputs either to raw `.txt` 
file or to a ```.sql``` file as a MySQL insert statement.

Use the PHP scripts in the ```php``` folder to query the database generated by the ```.sql``` file. 

Bash script usage:
------

```
./rainbowgen.sh [-sql] [/path/to/wordlist.txt]
```

Use the file path of a newline-separated word list of your choosing as the script's argument. 
Passing the ```-sql``` flag will prepare the hashed wordlist as an SQL statement for database 
insertion. Otherwise, a plain text file is output.

If no filename argument is passed, rainbowgen will prompt for the wordlist path. 

This script requires OpenSSL.

Creating the MySQL Database:
------

```
mysql -u user -p < yourlist-hashed.sql
```
If you're working with entries in the millions or billions++, you'll probably have to tweak your MySQL server settings, 
possibly increasing variables such as ```max_allowed_packet```,  ```net_read_timeout```, ```net_write_timeout```, 
```wait_timeout```, and/or ```interactive_timeout```.

Configure user privileges as appropriate.

PHP script usage:
------

Use the ```index.php``` form to query the database by reverse md5 or sha1 lookup, 
or by cleartext, and see the results fetched by ```rainbow.php```.
