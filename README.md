rainbowgen
==========

Generate MD5 &amp; SHA-1 lookup tables from a user-supplied wordlist. Outputs either to raw ```.txt``` file or to an ```.sql``` file as a MySQL insert statement.

Use the PHP scripts in the ```php``` folder to query the database generated by the ```.sql``` file. 

Bash script usage:
------

```
./rainbowgen.sh [-sql] [/path/to/wordlist.txt]
```

Passing the ```-sql``` flag will prepare the hashed wordlist as an SQL statement for database insertion. 

If no filename argument is passed, rainbowgen will prompt for the wordlist path. 

This script requires OpenSSL.

PHP script usage:
------

Self-explanatory. Use the ```index.php``` form to query the database by reverse md5 or sha1 lookup, or by cleartext, and see the results fetched by ```rainbow.php```.
